                <p>This is a web app for creating study flashcards. I created this after I took Colt Steele's web
                    Developer Bootcamp on Udemy. I created a Mongo database where a user can upload and 
                    scroll through their flashcards. This project was a good reinforcement of my knowledge of
                    RESTful Routing and Express.

                <h6>Iperbot</h6>
                <p>IperBot is an internal project developed by several interns and designers at 
                    Iperdesign. This was my first project in Unity. It was a deep dive into a very 
                    unfamiliar API which made for a challenging experience. Testing the game with users 
                    was a major part of this project as well. It was important that the difficulty was 
                    appropriate in such a way that experienced gamers could have fun and less experienced 
                    gamers would not be overwhelmed.

                <h6>Valve Visaid</h6>
                <p>​
                    The visual aid is a simple app to help customers understand their
                    valve device. The app was designed with engaging UI interactions to direct 
                    users through the graphics and copy in a way that they could efficiently grasp 
                    the information. My role was creating the UI through XCode to copy the designed 
                    UI as closely as possible. This project particularly improved my knowledge of 
                    constraints in creating a layout that could adapt to different sized devices.

                <p>​
                    Government Bodies is a single view app that allows users to mix their 
                    favorite animals with their favorite (or least favorite) political figures. 
                    This was my first app and a very fun project. Users can scroll or randomize 
                    through images and send their creations to friends.

                <p>​
                    Make A Note is a note-taking app for iOS, created on XCode, allowing 
                    users to write notes and save them to their devices. I developed this 
                    app in my free time. It was very helpful in learning how to handle 
                    multiple view controllers. It is available for download on the Apple app store.
