        <!-- <p>IperBot is an internal project developed by several interns and designers at 
            Iperdesign. This was my first project in Unity. It was a deep dive into a very 
            unfamiliar API which made for a challenging experience. Testing the game with users 
            was a major part of this project as well. It was important that the difficulty was 
            appropriate in such a way that experienced gamers could have fun and less experienced 
            gamers would not be overwhelmed.
